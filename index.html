    <p style="text-align: center">
      Roses are red,<br />
      I love your kindness,<br />
      You are very funny,<br />
      See you in bed. ;)
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
      Since the day I've met you, I had always liked your personality and how
      you've acted like being kind and not being a toxic person and I really
      appreciate it when you helped me when I was down and always try to calm me
      down when I rage in minecraft. <br />
      My life has changed since I've met you from me being happier to have a
      reason to exist and me not feeling lonely anymore. <br />
      Maybe I'm jumping the gun here but i truly hope that in the future we will
      have a prosperous life together and maybe have kids ;). <br />
      But yea, I will be there to support you in your life journey no matter
      what I have to sacrifice because you mean the world to me. <br />
      I look forward to loving you for a lifetime bri. <br />
      By the way, anyone who says Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth has
      clearly never stood next to you! and when I think about you, I end up with
      a stupid grin on my face.
